Install dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

and then run the build:

```sh
yarn build
```

to then be able to run a component via:

```sh
yarn start button
```

## Decisions

- All scripts are run through the `yarn` command
- The `helpers/` folder includes all helpers for builds, docs, testing etc
- We have two different example / doc concerns:
  1. Examples: they are for building components locally and to explain code per component
  1. Docs: this is a website that includes all components and be published to https://westpacgel.github.io/GEL/
- Multi-brand will be achieved by added a brand package that will be passed to the `<GEL/>` component

  ```jsx
  import { GEL } from '@westpac/core';
  import brand from '@westpac/WBC';

  export const App = () => <GEL brand={brand}>Your app</GEL>;
  ```

- Tokens and overrides (everything regarding consistent branding) will be contained in the brand packages in `brands/*`
- Tokens will include these four categories:
  - `colors`
  - `layout`
  - `packs`
  - `spacing`
  - `type`
- All components use named exports as the default, no default exports
- All brands components will have a default export containing the "tokens" objects in addition to the named exports of each.
- Each component has overrides that can be overridden by:

  1. overrides contained in the brand object
  2. overrides passed into `<GEL/>` wrapper
  3. overrides passed to the component directly via the `overrides` prop

  ```jsx
  import { GEL } from '@westpac/core';
  import brand from '@westpac/WBC';

  brand['@westpac/tabcordion'].TabItem.styles = ( styles, state ) => { ...styles, border: 'red solid 2px' };
  brand['@westpac/tabcordion'].TabRow.component = <TabRow />;

  export const App = () => <GEL brand={brand}>Your app</GEL>;
  ```

- These overrides are pre-defined in the component them-self and will be reconciled as a cascade
- Each package can be addressed by its name as the key in the tokens
- The `example/` folder is for documenting composition of several components together e.g. templates
- Fonts can't be shipped with npm so the tokens only define the css declarations for the fonts
- css-in-js [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) is used with the `jsx` pragma and babel plugin
- For css-in-js we use `jsx` imported from `@westpac/core` and never depend on `emotion` directly other than inside core itself
- All components that are made up of a group of other components like `list`, `breadcrumb`, `button-group`, `input-group` etc can be driven solely by the
  `data` prop
- If children have to be altered inside a component we use the `cloneElement` function when we know it's a shallow depth.
  We use context when we don't know how deep the children are going to be.

### Data driven API

Components that are made up by other components like `list`, `breadcrumb`, `button-group`, `input-group` etc can be solely driven by the `data` prop.
We also offer declarative APIs in-case a consumer wants to wrap a component.

```jsx
<Breadcrumb>
	<Crumb href="#/" text="Home" />
	<Crumb href="#/personal-banking/" text="Personal" />
	<Crumb href="#/credit-cards/" text="Credit cards" />
</Breadcrumb>
```

Is the same as:

```jsx
<Breadcrumb
	data={[
		{ href: '#/', text: 'Home' },
		{ href: '#/personal-banking/', text: 'Personal' },
		{ href: '#/credit-cards/', text: 'Credit cards' },
	]}
/>
```

### How we handle focus state

We use the useFocus hook in the `GEL` component.
You can [read about the focus hook on medium](https://medium.com/@wilkowskidom/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-outline-7a35b3b49e7).
The `GEL` also adds the global focus styling from our `PACKS.focus` token pack.
If you need to add it to something use:

```js
':focus': {
	...PACKS.focus,
},
```

However if you need a focus state that will persist across mouse users do something like this:

```jsx
const { PACKS } = useBrand();

const focus = { ...PACKS.focus };
focus.outline += ' !important'; // adding `!important` will make sure the focus persists

<Component
	css={{
		':focus': { ...focus },
	}}
/>;
```

### TOKENS

| name      | purpose                                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COLORS`  | Our colors including tints                               |
| `LAYOUT`  | Only breakpoints so far                                  |
| `PACKS`   | Mostly typography packs for reuse and consistency        |
| `SPACING` | A function with minor scale to allow you to hit the grid |
| `TYPE`    | Font files and definitions                               |
| `BRAND`   | The current brand string                                 |

## Overrides naming convention

Every single component (including root component) have three items in their override object:

```
overrides = {
	ComponentName : {
		[name]: {
			styles: (base-styles, state-props) => styles,
			component: <React.Component/>
			attributes: (base-attributes, state-props) => Object,
		}
	}
}
```

| Key          | Type                 | Description                                                                            | Function arguments                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `styles`     | `function` => Object | A function that returns an object of css properties for emotion                        | (`base-styles`,`state/props`) `base-styles` = the styles that would have been applied to the component, `state/props` = all props and all known state (without setters)             |
| `attributes` | `function` => Object | A function that returns an object of attributes that will be spread onto the component | (`base-attributes`,`state/props`) `base-attributes` = the attributes that would have been applied to the component, `state/props` = all props and all known state (without setters) |
| `component`  | `react component`    | A react component which will receive all props                                         | -                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Naming convention for files inside components

| name            | purpose                                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.js`      | Export only public API                                                      |
| `_utils.js`     | For code shared between components (ignored in examples) `[optional]`       |
| `ComponentX.js` | All component files are named after the exported component and pascal cased |
| `00-*.js`       | All files inside the `examples/` folder are sorted by file name             |
| `*.js`          | All jsx files are postfixed with `.js`                                      |
| `*.spec.js`     | All (jest) unit tests are postfixed with `.spec.js`                         |

## Props API vocabulary

| Prop                                       | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tag`                                      | When a component can be rendered as different tags                                                          |
| `look`                                     | When talking about the look of a component like `success` or `hero`                                         |
| `href`                                     | When something points at a thing via a link                                                                 |
| `icon` `iconLeft` `iconRight`              | For passing in an icon                                                                                      |
| `disabled` or `noBorder`                   | For passing boolean flags we use natural language and not `is` or `has` prefixes                            |
| `size`                                     | For the physical size of a component, should be: `'small', 'medium', 'large', 'xlarge'`                     |
| `spacing`                                  | For the whitspace size of a component, should be: `'small', 'medium', 'large', 'xlarge'`                    |
| `value`                                    | For when a component shows a value, often numbers but not only                                              |
| `selected`                                 | For things inside lists that are being targeted. Like `ButtonGroups` or `CheckGroup`. Takes string or array |
| `label`                                    | For labeling things that are visible or a11y text                                                           |
| `xsmall` `small` `medium` `large` `xlarge` | For t-shirt sizing                                                                                          |
| `data`                                     | A prop to drive a component-group from data alone                                                           |
