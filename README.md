## Design System

The design system components are spread between two folders:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ brands/     # The brand components
â””â”€â”€ components/ # The design system components including core
```

There are two different ways you can run the components locally:

1. [Component build](#component-build)
1. [Docs build](#docs-build)

### Some high level decisions

- All components use named exports as the default, no default exports
- All brands components will have a default export containing the "tokens" objects in addition to the named exports of each.
- Fonts can't be shipped with npm so the tokens only define the css declarations for the fonts
- For css-in-js we use `jsx` imported from `@westpac/core` and never depend on `emotion` directly other than inside core itself

### Theming / Multi-brand

Multi-brand will be achieved by added a brand package that will be passed to the `<GEL/>` component

```jsx
import { GEL } from '@westpac/core';
import brand from '@westpac/WBC';

export const App = () => <GEL brand={brand}>Your app</GEL>;
```

The brand package includes tokens and overrides and will be available to all packages inside the `<GEL/>` wrapper via context.
This allows us to be as consistent as can be within the same app.
It also separates out all things theming to a single package.
The brand package does not need to know anything about it's components.
But it can opt in.

<details>
<summary>ðŸ‘‰ Tokens</summary>

| name      | purpose                                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COLORS`  | Our colors including tints                               |
| `LAYOUT`  | Only breakpoints so far                                  |
| `PACKS`   | Mostly typography packs for reuse and consistency        |
| `SPACING` | A function with minor scale to allow you to hit the grid |
| `TYPE`    | Font files and definitions                               |
| `BRAND`   | The current brand string                                 |

</details>

### Overrides

A consumer may choose to override a component in it's build.
This can happen by adding the overrides into the same name-space as the component you wish to override.

```jsx
import { Tabcordion } from '@westpac/tabcordion';
import { GEL } from '@westpac/core';
import brand from '@westpac/wbc';

brand['@westpac/tabcordion'].TabItem.styles = ( styles, state ) => { ...styles, border: 'red solid 2px' };
brand['@westpac/tabcordion'].TabRow.component = <TabRow />;

export const App = () => (
	<GEL brand={brand}>
		All instances of the <Tabcordion/> now include the override specified above.
		No matter how many there are.
	</GEL>
);
```

There may also a need to add an override only to a single instance of the component.
In that case you may add the override to the component directly via the `override` prop each component has.

```jsx
import { Tabcordion } from '@westpac/tabcordion';
import { GEL } from '@westpac/core';
import brand from '@westpac/wbc';

brand['@westpac/tabcordion'].Tabcordion.styles = ( styles, state ) => { ...styles, border: 'red solid 2px' };

const override = {
	Tabcordion: {
		styles: ( styles, state ) => { ...styles, border: 'blue solid 2px' },
	},
};

export const App = () => (
	<GEL brand={brand}>
		<Tabcordion/> with red border
		<Tabcordion override={override} /> with blue border
		<Tabcordion/> with red border
	</GEL>
);
```

_(ðŸ’¡ Overrides will be reconciled as a cascade from less-specific to most-specific.)_

Every single component (including root component) have three items in their override object:

```
overrides = {
	[name]: {
		styles: (base-styles, state-props) => styles,
		component: <React.Component/>
		attributes: (base-attributes, state-props) => Object,
	}
}
```

<summary>ðŸ‘‰ Overrides</summary>

| Key          | Type                 | Description                                                                            | Function arguments                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `styles`     | `function` => Object | A function that returns an object of css properties for emotion                        | (`base-styles`,`state/props`) `base-styles` = the styles that would have been applied to the component, `state/props` = all props and all known state (without setters)             |
| `attributes` | `function` => Object | A function that returns an object of attributes that will be spread onto the component | (`base-attributes`,`state/props`) `base-attributes` = the attributes that would have been applied to the component, `state/props` = all props and all known state (without setters) |
| `component`  | `react component`    | A react component which will receive all props                                         | -                                                                                                                                                                                   |

</details>

### Data driven API

Components that are made up by other components like `list`, `breadcrumb`, `button-group`, `input-group` etc can be solely driven by the `data` prop.
We also offer declarative APIs in-case a consumer wants to wrap a component.

```jsx
<Breadcrumb>
	<Crumb href="#/" text="Home" />
	<Crumb href="#/personal-banking/" text="Personal" />
	<Crumb href="#/credit-cards/" text="Credit cards" />
</Breadcrumb>
```

Is the same as:

```jsx
<Breadcrumb
	data={[
		{ href: '#/', text: 'Home' },
		{ href: '#/personal-banking/', text: 'Personal' },
		{ href: '#/credit-cards/', text: 'Credit cards' },
	]}
/>
```

### How we handle focus state

We use the useFocus hook in the `GEL` component.
You can [read about the focus hook on medium](https://medium.com/@wilkowskidom/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-outline-7a35b3b49e7).
The `GEL` also adds the global focus styling from our `PACKS.focus` token pack.
If you need to add it to something use:

```jsx
':focus': {
	...PACKS.focus,
},
```

However if you need a focus state that will persist across mouse users do something like this:

```jsx
const { PACKS } = useBrand();

const focus = { ...PACKS.focus };
focus.outline += ' !important'; // adding `!important` will make sure the focus persists

<Component
	css={{
		':focus': { ...focus },
	}}
/>;
```

### Component build

This build is running all the components examples/demos directly and nothing else.
It's for development of a component and for testing it.

You run it via:

```sh
cd path/to/root/of/repo
yarn dev [component name]
```

### Docs build

This build is for the developer documentation site that puts all the examples of all components together with a navigation.
It's for the docs that are automatically published to:

## Blender support

[The blender](https://github.com/WestpacGEL/blender) can generate human readable html and css from react and emotion components.
For this to work we require `label` attributes in our `css` prop, a couple files to blend and the `blender` key inside your `package.json`.

### `getLabel`

We have to add labels for every variations for props.
To archive this we have the `getLabel` function that you can import from `@westpac/core`.
Make sure you only add variations that will change CSS.
Adding more means more css classes and more html.
The best way to do this I found was to add the labels to the overrides files:

- look at the `[something]Styles` function
- copy all props from there that are being constructed
- go to the css props and insert `getLabel` with an appropriate prefix

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, getLabel } from '@westpac/core';

const Component = ({ state, ...rest }) => <div {...rest} />;

const componentStyles = (_, { dismissible, look }) => {
	//     There are two props here ----^

	const styleMap = {}; // more code here
	return {
		// The `Component-prefix` is also important to name what (sub)component this is
		label: getLabel('Component-prefix', { dismissible, look }),
		//                          ----^
		// So we add those two into the getLabel function
		padding: dismissible ? '1.125rem 1.875rem 1.125rem 1.125rem' : '1.125rem',
		// you can see here --^ how the prop changes css dynamically
		transition: 'opacity 300ms ease-in-out',
		opacity: 1,
		borderTop: '1px solid',
		borderBottom: '1px solid',
		...styleMap[look].css,
		// here too we change css dynamically with props
	};
};

const componentAttributes = () => null;

export const defaultComponent = {
	component: Component,
	styles: componentStyles,
	attributes: componentAttributes,
};
```

For the prefixes try to name so it's visible what is a parent of what.

So `getLabel('Component')` on the root component and `getLabel('Component-subcomponent')` on the sub-component will become:

```html
<div class="GEL-Component-v1_0_0-props">
	<div class="GEL-Component-v1_0_0-subcomponent-props">
		Your sub-component
	</div>
</div>
```

### Js fallback

Since the blender just SSR each component it won't provide the functionality of react and any interactivity.
For this you have to provide a `js` file for fallback.
In the GEL3 we use jQuery for this.
Each jQuery file should target elements via the `data-js` attribute since classes can vary depending on your blend settings.
So things like `data-js="body"` or `data-js="component-closebtn"` should work well and you target this via `$('[data-js="component-closebtn"]')` in jQuery.

### Core components

Inside the `package.json`

```json
"blender": {
	"recipe": "path/to/recipe.js",
	"js": "path/to/jquery-lib.js",
	"isCore": true
},
```

The `js` file should contain any framework other component rely on.
In our case that's jQuery.

The `recipe` file must export two named components `AllStyles` and `Docs`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Component } from '../src/index.js';

export function AllStyles({ brand, children }) {
	return <Component brand={brand}>{children}</Component>;
}

export function Docs({ brand }) {
	return [
		{
			heading: 'The Core Component',
			component: () => (
				<Component brand={brand}>Add your GEL components inside the Core component</Component>
			),
		},
	];
}
```

Both of these function get the `brand` object passed in and only in core `AllStyles` also get's `children` so we can remove core from the other components later.
The `Docs` component returns an array with a `heading` and a `component` key.

In short:

- The `AllStyles` component should contain all possible variations for a component
- The `Docs` component should contain everything we want to show in the documentation.

### Other components

Inside the `package.json`

```json
"blender": {
	"recipe": "blender/recipe.js",
	"js": "blender/script.js"
},
```

The `js` file is optional and only required if you have js functionality.

The `recipe` file must export two named components `AllStyles` and `Docs`:

```jsx
import { GEL } from '@westpac/core';
import React from 'react';

import { Component } from '@westpac/alert';

export function AllStyles({ brand }) {
	return (
		<GEL brand={brand}>
			<Component look="success" />
			<Component look="info" />
			<Component look="warning" />
			<Component heading="Your alert heading" />
			<Component dismissible />
		</GEL>
	);
}

export function Docs({ brand }) {
	return [
		{
			heading: 'A success alert',
			component: () => (
				<GEL brand={brand}>
					<Component look="success">Your alert body</Component>
				</GEL>
			),
		},
		{
			heading: 'A info alert',
			component: () => (
				<GEL brand={brand}>
					<Component look="info">Your alert body</Component>
				</GEL>
			),
		},
		{
			heading: 'A warning alert',
			component: () => (
				<GEL brand={brand}>
					<Component look="warning">Your alert body</Component>
				</GEL>
			),
		},
	];
}
```

Same as the core component.
