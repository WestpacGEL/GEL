### Adding a new component

To add a new component (aka package), run the below command from the root of the project and then follow the prompts:

```sh
yarn new my-component-name
```

_Note: replace `my-component-name` with the component you wish to add._

This will create a new entry in the `/components` directory with all of the files you need to get started and with all dependencies installed. Please note that this component will be TypeScript.

### Editing an existing component

To edit a component, including if you've just added one using the steps above, use the below command from the root of the project:

```sh
yarn dev my-component-name
```

_Note: replace `my-component-name` with the component you wish to run._

This component can now be viewed on `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Design System

The design system components are spread between two folders:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ brands/     # The brand components
â””â”€â”€ components/ # The design system components including core
```

There are two different ways you can run the components locally:

1. [Component build](#component-build)
1. [Docs build](#docs-build)

### Some high level decisions

- All components use named exports as the default, no default exports
- All brands components will have a default export containing the "tokens" objects in addition to the named exports of each.
- Fonts can't be shipped with npm so the tokens only define the css declarations for the fonts
- For css-in-js we use `jsx` imported from `@westpac/core` and never depend on `emotion` directly other than inside core itself

### Theming / Multi-brand

Multi-brand will be achieved by added a brand package that will be passed to the `<GEL/>` component

```jsx
import { GEL } from '@westpac/core';
import brand from '@westpac/WBC';

export const App = () => <GEL brand={brand}>Your app</GEL>;
```

The brand package includes tokens and overrides and will be available to all packages inside the `<GEL/>` wrapper via context.
This allows us to be as consistent as can be within the same app.
It also separates out all things to do with theming into a single package.
The brand package does not need to know anything about its components.
But it can opt in.

<details>
<summary>ðŸ‘‰ Tokens</summary>

| name      | purpose                                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COLORS`  | Our colors including tints                               |
| `LAYOUT`  | Only breakpoints so far                                  |
| `PACKS`   | Mostly typography packs for reuse and consistency        |
| `SPACING` | A function with minor scale to allow you to hit the grid |
| `TYPE`    | Font files and definitions                               |
| `BRAND`   | The current brand string                                 |

</details>

### Overrides

A consumer may choose to override a component in its build.
This can happen by adding the overrides into the same namespace as the component you wish to override.

```jsx
import { Tabcordion } from '@westpac/tabcordion';
import { GEL } from '@westpac/core';
import brand from '@westpac/wbc';

brand['@westpac/tabcordion'].TabItem.styles = ( styles, state ) => { ...styles, border: 'red solid 2px' };
brand['@westpac/tabcordion'].TabRow.component = <TabRow />;

export const App = () => (
	<GEL brand={brand}>
		All instances of the <Tabcordion/> now include the override specified above.
		No matter how many there are.
	</GEL>
);
```

There may also a need to add an override only to a single instance of the component.
In that case you may add the override to the component directly via the `overrides` prop each component has.

```jsx
import { Tabcordion } from '@westpac/tabcordion';
import { GEL } from '@westpac/core';
import brand from '@westpac/wbc';

brand['@westpac/tabcordion'].Tabcordion.styles = ( styles, state ) => { ...styles, border: 'red solid 2px' };

const overrides = {
	Tabcordion: {
		styles: ( styles, state ) => { ...styles, border: 'blue solid 2px' },
	},
};

export const App = () => (
	<GEL brand={brand}>
		<Tabcordion/> with red border
		<Tabcordion overrides={overrides} /> with blue border
		<Tabcordion/> with red border
	</GEL>
);
```

_(ðŸ’¡ Overrides will be reconciled as a cascade from less-specific to most-specific.)_

Every single component (including root component) have three items in their override object:

```
overrides = {
	[name]: {
		styles: (base-styles, state-props) => styles,
		component: <React.Component/>
		attributes: (base-attributes, state-props) => Object,
	}
}
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ‘‰ Overrides</summary>

| Key          | Type                 | Description                                                                            | Function arguments                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `styles`     | `function` => Object | A function that returns an object of css properties for emotion                        | (`base-styles`,`state/props`) `base-styles` = the styles that would have been applied to the component, `state/props` = all props and all known state (without setters)             |
| `attributes` | `function` => Object | A function that returns an object of attributes that will be spread onto the component | (`base-attributes`,`state/props`) `base-attributes` = the attributes that would have been applied to the component, `state/props` = all props and all known state (without setters) |
| `component`  | `react component`    | A react component which will receive all props                                         | -                                                                                                                                                                                   |

</details>

### Data driven API

Components that are made up by other components like `list`, `breadcrumb`, `button-group`, `input-group` etc can be solely driven by the `data` prop.
We also offer declarative APIs in-case a consumer wants to wrap a component.

```jsx
<Breadcrumb>
	<Crumb href="#/" text="Home" />
	<Crumb href="#/personal-banking/" text="Personal" />
	<Crumb href="#/credit-cards/" text="Credit cards" />
</Breadcrumb>
```

Is the same as:

```jsx
<Breadcrumb
	data={[
		{ href: '#/', text: 'Home' },
		{ href: '#/personal-banking/', text: 'Personal' },
		{ href: '#/credit-cards/', text: 'Credit cards' },
	]}
/>
```

### How we handle focus state

We use the useFocus hook in the `GEL` component.
You can [read about the focus hook on medium](https://medium.com/@wilkowskidom/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-outline-7a35b3b49e7).
The `GEL` also adds the global focus styling from our `PACKS.focus` token pack.
If you need to add it to something use:

```jsx
':focus': {
	...PACKS.focus,
},
```

However if you need a focus state that will persist across mouse users do something like this:

```jsx
const { PACKS } = useBrand();

const focus = { ...PACKS.focus };
focus.outline += ' !important'; // adding `!important` will make sure the focus persists

<Component
	css={{
		':focus': { ...focus },
	}}
/>;
```

### Component build

This build is running all the components examples/demos directly and nothing else.
It's for development of a component and for testing it.

You run it via:

```sh
cd path/to/root/of/repo
yarn dev [component name]
```

## Blender support

[The blender](https://github.com/WestpacGEL/blender) can generate human readable html and css from react and emotion components.

Read more about how you add blender support in the blender [README.md](https://github.com/WestpacGEL/blender/tree/master#how-to-add-blender-support).
