				‘It was much pleasanter at home,’ thought poor Alice, ‘when one wasn’t always growing larger
				and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down
				that rabbit-hole — and yet — and yet — it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I
				do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind
				of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book
				written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I’ll write one.

				The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in
				getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,
				but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give
				the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with
				such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had
				got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the
				hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there
				was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and,
				as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the
				ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

				The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the
				Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
				<br />
				‘Who are you?’ said the Caterpillar.
				<br />
				This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, ‘I — I
				hardly know, sir, just at present — at least I know who I was when I got up this morning,
				but I think I must have been changed several times since then.’
				<br />
				‘What do you mean by that?’ said the Caterpillar sternly. ‘Explain yourself!’
				<br />
				‘I can’t explain myself, I’m afraid, sir’ said Alice, ’because I’m not myself, you see.’
				<br />
				‘I don’t see,’ said the Caterpillar.
				<br />
				‘I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,’ Alice replied very politely, ‘for I can’t
				understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very
				confusing.’
